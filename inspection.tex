Some semantic features allow a language to inspect some arbitrarily deep part of the stack, or compute a property of the whole stack before continuing.
Java's access control security features are an example of the first form of inspection, and garbage collection is an example of the second.
These features are easily modeled wit
$\mktab$ forms a regular language of stacks for every context.


 If we have a regular language of acceptable stacks to continue down some path, we can perform a non-emptiness check of the intersection of that language and the language that $\mktab$ defines for the current context.
