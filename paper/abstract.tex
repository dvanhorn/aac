The strengths of dynamic languages are also their weaknesses: these languages' flexibility makes them unpredictable -- statically, that is.
%
Static analyses for dynamic languages are few, far between, and seldom sound.
%
The reasons why range from there being too much unknown before run-time to make useful predictions, to such reusable code that standard data- and control-flow analyses are too imprecise to tease about their different uses, to features that are just too hard to model in traditional analytical frameworks.
%
We propose an analysis construction method that aims to ameliorate the second two of these hurdles.
%

%
Dynamic languages are sometimes referred to as ``interpreted languages'' because some of their features are either too difficult to compile ahead of time, or the features' runtime support resembles the interpreter pattern.
%
The Abstracting Abstract Machines (AAM) method of analysis construction needs little more than a language's interpreter to make a sound approximation of its behavior.
%
AAM thus stands as the simplest road to making analyses for dynamic languages.
%
We improve its precision to better serve dynamic languages by targeting a stronger computational model: pushdown systems.
%
We then show that the techniques scale to precise modeling of delimited, composable first-class control operators, {\tt shift} and {\tt reset}.
%
All of this we do without touching automata theory.
