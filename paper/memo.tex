Context irrelevance means if we have seen the results of a computation before from a different context, we can reuse them.
%
The semantic counterpart to this idea is a memo table that we extend when popping and appeal to when about to push.
%
This simple idea works well with a deterministic semantics, but the non-determinism of abstraction requires care.

%
What happens if we use the memo table and then the fixed-point computation finds another result for that context?
